*The game is not finished.*

Have you ever played an RPG game and wondered: 
> “I want a game, where somebody else has fun, and I’m only managing his inventory.”

well… then this is a game for you!

The player that hired you for free, needs to have the best possible equipment. What will you choose? More potions, or maybe better armor? (game balance not included) Choose wisely, because carry weight is heavily limited.

Drag items to your inventory with left mouse button Equip items with right mouse button

Interesting facts:

* Background music may or may not sound bad on speakers, try headphones if possible!

* This is our first Ludum Dare entry, and while typing this Description (1 hour before Deadline), we still have problems getting it to work :)

* We had problems with representing our Game in Cover Image, so looks liiiitle bit different.
